The program gets two numbers and displays the larger of the two.
```c
#include <stdio.h>          //includes required header stdio.h

int main(void)              //declares main function
{
    int a, b;               //declares two variables, a and b
    scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);   //reads two integers from stdin, seperated by a space, and assigns them to the previously declared variables
    if (a>b)                //checks if a is larger than b
        printf("%d\n",a);   //prints a to stdout
    else                    //a smaller or equal to b
        printf("%d\n",b);   //prints b to stdout
    return 0;               //returns
}
```
